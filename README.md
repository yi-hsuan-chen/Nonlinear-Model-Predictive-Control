This project is the course project of EE 372 Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). 
The aim of this project is to develope an NMPC-based controller to achieve trajectory tracking of a quadrotor subject to constrained inputs.

The optimal control problem is reformulated into a nonlinear programming problem, then solved by
open-source optimization tool CasADi.
